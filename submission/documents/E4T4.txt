# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Move the web app instance to the private subnet

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Yes, because we would restrict the access to the s3bucket to a specific point, reducing the security risk related to the S3 bucket

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- Yes

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- We would update the resources the same way as using the CLI. I have made the changes using the Cloudformation and not the CLI because I thought it would be best practice. 
I can confirm that I could perform all the modifications. Review the cloud templates and check the differences from the original ones :D
