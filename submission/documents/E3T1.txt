# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
From the documentation about the issue at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_finding-types-ec2.html#unauthorizedaccess-ec2-sshbruteforce:

"This finding is generated only through monitoring traffic on port 22. If your SSH services are configured to use other ports, this finding is not generated."

As we can observe, GuardDuty monitors by default the traffic at port 22 for this type of attacks.
