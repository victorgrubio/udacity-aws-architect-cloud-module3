Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Apart from the vulnerabilities shown for my other projects (will review that as soon as possible), the main issues found are: 
- Lack of encryption in S3 buckets, as signaled in previous text exercise.
- S3 not requiring SSL for connection
- Load balancer not redirecting to HTTPS
- Serveral important ports exposed for access in web app instance

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- S3 encryption enabled
- Enable SSL for the S3
- Redirecting to HTTPS for HTTP requests (load balancer)
- Restrict ingress access in security group for ec2 instance
